This tool provides a nice Travian-World-Map. Copyright by ultimate...

Launch the programm with
> TravianWorldMapGenerator.bat

In the console you can add additional args
Type > TravianWorldMapGenerator -helpS
Type > TravianWorldMapGenerator -confS
for explanation...

In order to have full features have a look at s5.bat.
There are some args added to enable more features. Those features are enabled only via additional
args and offer the opportunity to offer this tool to other alliances without full functionality... ;-)

To enable user defined map displaying a *.properties-File is required:
_________________________________________________

# lines starting with # will be comments...

# This line provides the source of the map.sql file
# The file can as well be local on your pc or on an server in the www:
map.sql=http://s5.travian.com/map.sql

# This is the standard group. All players, that are not in any group are displayed in this group.
# name of the group
group.0.name=Occupied Fields
# Color of this group in r,g,b
group.0.color=153,153,153
# The attributes ...allies and ...players are meant to add alliances and players to several groups

# In the following you can define as many groups as you like (as long as you are in the group limit)
# as long as they are numbered without a gap
group.1.name=name of this group
group.1.color=0,0,255
group.1.allies=123,456
group.1.players=4,4567
_________________________________________________

The *.properties-Datei may be located in the folder "bin" or in the programs main folder.
When launching the programm a dialogue will ask for the *.properties-file. You only have to enter the name without file-extension.
